When I was little, I always had **so many ideas** popping up in mind *every single day*.

But there was one problem that always bothers me - how can I turn them into realities? The answer is of course not ~daydreaming~!

While I kept searching for answers, I found the best path to chase after my goal at 17 years old. The answer is coding.

So without hesistation, I dive into the world of different programming languages. Different than many other coders, I was chasing after the fact of turning ideas into a application instead of the quality of the product.

In the fall of 2018, I wrote my first line of python code, and it of course was:

```
print("Hello world!")
```

When I entered college, I realized that a veteran coder cares about many different aspects other than simply displaying the functionalities.

Therefore, my new goal is to write GOOD programs that run fast and efficiently. And I follow the Steve Jobs quote: 
>“Be a yardstick of quality. Some people aren’t used to an environment where excellence is expected.”
